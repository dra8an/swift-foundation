## What this project is

A pure-Swift implementation of the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UTS #10 /
CLDR root + tailorings), ported from ICU4C's "collation v2" design following
the ICU4X architectural model (always-on fused NFD decomposition, no FCD, no
canonical closure in data). Target: eventual contribution to swift-foundation
(milestone 8, ON HOLD awaiting maintainer/community input — do not start it
unprompted).

## Where everything is

This project has been worked on from two machines. Paths differ:

**Machine 2 (Apple Silicon, current as of 2026-06-17):**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/Projects/dra8an/swift-foundation-collation/` | git clone, branch `port/collation` |
| `.../swift-foundation-collation/Collation/` | **the SwiftPM package root** (name: `Collation`) and these docs (`Docs/`) |
| `~/Projects/Unicode/icu-DraganBesevic-2/` | ICU4C 79.0.1 source + build (`icu4c/source/lib/`) |

**Machine 1 (Intel iMac, original development):**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/Projects/claude/collation/swift-foundation/` | git worktree, branch `port/collation`, based on `upstream/release/6.3` |
| `.../swift-foundation/Collation/` | **the SwiftPM package root** |
| `~/Projects/claude/swift-foundation/` | user's MAIN checkout — calendars project. **Never touch.** |
| `~/Projects/claude/icu/` | ICU4C 79.0.1 source clone |
| `~/Projects/claude/collation/icu-build/` | local ICU build |

Remotes: `origin` = github.com/dra8an/swift-foundation (user's fork, push
target), `upstream` = swiftlang (never push). Branch tracks origin.

## Hard rules (user-mandated)

1. **NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any Claude/Anthropic reference to
   commits.** History was rewritten once to purge them. Before every push:
   verify messages (`git log --format=%B | grep -ci 'claude\|co-authored\|anthropic'`
   must be 0) and author/committer identity (must be dra8an), and show the
   user the verification.
2. Push only when the user says push (they always ask explicitly).
3. Plain terminology: no testing jargon — "ICU reference answers" not
   "oracle", "option set" not "configuration".
4. Swift 6.4 does NOT compile on machine 1; everything bases on
   `upstream/release/6.3` (toolchain: Swift 6.3.1).
5. Transient `.git/worktrees/swift-foundation/index.lock` collisions happen
   on machine 1 (likely Atom's git polling). Wait a few seconds, re-check for
   live git processes, remove the zero-byte lock only if stale, retry.
6. The user values: decision records for surprising scope cuts, honest
   skip-counting in tests, investigating failing imported expectations
   against ICU source before "fixing" our code (twice the expectations were
   wrong, not the implementation).
7. **Git identity for this repo:** `dra8an <chonbey@hotmail.com>` (set via
   `git config --local`). GPG signing is disabled locally
   (`commit.gpgsign = false`).

## Current state (2026-06-17)

- **Milestones 1–7 complete** (plan + per-milestone reports in `Docs/`):
  full UCA runtime — fused NFD, all strengths/settings, contractions
  (incl. discontiguous S2.1) and prefixes, sort keys **byte-identical to
  ucol_getSortKey**, 15 locale tailorings incl. zh script reordering.
- **Milestone 7.5 complete** (perf rounds 1–13): every portable ICU test
  suite is ported, plus perf rounds. **61 tests / 19 suites, all green.**
  Suites: official UCA conformance (433k lines), collationtest.txt
  data-driven, Thai dictionary (31k words), 9 classic locale suites, regcoll
  (13 cases), cmsccoll (20 cases + extreme compression), g7coll locale rows,
  apicoll behavioral parts, differential matrices + byte-identical keys
  (21 option sets × 2 data variants), 52k fuzz keys.
- **Performance round 14 complete** (2026-06-16/17, documented in `Docs/14`):
  three changes shipped, four experiments tried and reverted:

  **Shipped:**
  1. **Thread-local scratch buffers** — replaced the locked `ScratchPool`
     with a process-wide pthread TLS key + monotonic collator ID. −19% CJK
     compare, −10% sort keys. Subsequently fixed for lifetime safety: one
     process-wide key (never deleted), monotonic IDs (no address reuse),
     removed dead `ScratchPool` and dead `ScratchBuffers.key` field.
  2. **`sortKey(for:into:)` inout API** — caller supplies the output buffer,
     eliminating per-call allocation + memcpy. −27% sort keys. The old
     returning variant delegates to it.
  3. **Span-based fast-Latin bail** — uses `String.utf8Span.span` (macOS 26+,
     `#available`-gated) for the byte-level prefix scan and Latin-eligibility
     check, so non-Latin text (CJK, Thai) never pays the
     `withContiguousStorageIfAvailable` closure overhead. −10% CJK compare.
     **Fixed after cross-machine review:** inline `#available` in `compare()`
     bloated codegen and regressed macOS 15 (+26% ASCII, +8% CJK). Fix:
     split into `compareClassic()` / `compareWithSpan()` / `compareBody()`
     — each compiled independently, shared tail prevents correctness drift.
     Buggy Span prefix skip (`spanPrefixSkip`) removed (53 test failures
     when isolated); Span now only handles the fast-Latin bail check.

  **Tried and reverted (do not re-attempt without reading `Docs/14`):**
  - Raw-UTF8 iterator path (approach a: nested closures, +3%; approach b:
    escaped pointer, UB — crashes)
  - Lock-free fast-Latin cache (use-after-free in concurrent tests)
  - Raw-pointer sort-key level buffers (slower than Array — see `Docs/16`)
  - Span-based prefix skip for full pipeline (+12% CJK regression — must
    rebuild iterators for CE pipeline, negating the gain; also had a scalar-
    counting correctness bug)

- **Pushed through `2278a07`; `origin/port/collation` is in sync.**
  Post-Span-revert optimizations:
  - Quick-primary CJK compare: bypasses CE pipeline for different CJK
    characters (−10% CJK).
  - Pre-baked fast-Latin setup: eliminates the per-call cache lock by
    storing primaries as UnsafeBufferPointer at init (−22% ASCII, −23%
    Latin, −16% paths). Full analysis in `Docs/18` §7-§8.
  - Scaling analysis confirmed: gap to ICU narrows with longer strings
    (~8-12 ns fixed per-call overhead dominates short strings).
  - Deletion experiments proved closures are zero-cost on Apple Silicon
    (compiler inlines them); the real cost was the cache lock.
  - Inline CE pipeline hot path: `@inline(__always)` on
    `NFDIterator.next()`, `CEIterator.popScalar()`, `appendMore()`.
    −5% CJK sortKey, −3% Latin/paths, −2% Thai/ASCII. Compare neutral
    for fast-Latin corpora.
  - Pre-computed `isUnsafe` safe threshold: scan at init finds the lowest
    unsafe code point (U+0300 for root). Short-circuits trie lookups on
    the prefix-skip safety check. −5% sorted ASCII 32, −4% sorted ASCII
    64 compare. Neutral on random corpora (no shared prefix to check).
  - Pre-computed ASCII CE table: 128-entry lookup of full 64-bit CEs,
    built at init. Sort key's `appendMore()` skips trie lookup + tag
    dispatch for simple ASCII characters. −14% ASCII, −6% Latin, −21%
    paths sortKey. Compare and CJK/Thai neutral.

### Current performance (Apple Silicon, quiet machine, 10000 reps, lower cluster)

**Compare (ns/op):**

| corpus | ours | ICU 79 | ratio |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| ASCII  | ~25  | ~9     | 2.8×  |

| CJK    | ~127 | ~41    | 3.1×  |
| paths  | ~63  | ~33    | 1.9×  |
| Thai (th, sorted) | ~394 | ~191 | 2.1× |

**Sort keys (inout API, buffer reused):**

| corpus | ours | ICU 79 | ratio |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| ASCII  | ~223 | ~107   | 2.1×  |
| Latin  | ~345 | ~126   | 2.7×  |

## Key findings from round 14 (read before optimizing further)

1. **`isUniquelyReferenced` is hoisted out of loops.** The profiler shows it
   as ~9% of samples, but the compiler calls it once before the loop, not per
   byte. Replacing Array with raw `UnsafeMutablePointer` is **slower** (11
   instructions/byte vs Array's 7) because the compiler reloads pointer+capacity
   from memory every iteration due to aliasing uncertainty. Full assembly
   analysis in `Docs/16`.

2. **`Span<UInt8>` exists in this toolchain** (`String.utf8Span.span`, macOS
   26+, `#available`-gated). It gives closure-free byte access that compiles
   to identical assembly as `withContiguousStorageIfAvailable`. BUT: it's
   `~Escapable` (can't be stored in struct fields), and passing it to a
   non-inlined function is **3.3× slower** due to lifetime-check overhead.
   Must use `@inline(__always)` throughout. Detailed benchmarks in `Docs/16` §9.

3. **The residual gap is per-call overhead**, not per-byte arithmetic:
   - String-access cost (`withContiguousStorageIfAvailable` / iterator ARC)
   - The fast-Latin cache lock (~10 ns)
   - CE pipeline function-call boundaries
   The collation arithmetic itself runs at ICU's speed.

## Deliberate scope cuts (don't re-litigate without reading the docs)

- **Runtime rule builder NOT ported** — `12-rule-builder-decision.md` has the
  full reasoning, costs, and porting plan. Tailorings are compiled binaries
  extracted from ICU's build (`Tools/extract_tailoring.c`).
- **Normalization cannot be turned off** (architectural); **unpaired
  surrogates unsupported** (Swift String); **reorder-table generation
  unsupported** (data-supplied reordering only). (Fast-Latin was a cut on
  the ICU4X precedent, reversed by user decision in M7.5 round 9 — the
  tables were already in the bundled data.)

## Open backlog

- **Rule builder** (doc 12) — parked, awaiting decision.
- **M8 Foundation integration** — parked, awaiting maintainer input.
- **Span-based CE pipeline refactor** — the remaining Span opportunity:
  thread `Span<UInt8>` through the full `CEIterator.appendMore()` →
  `NFDIterator.next()` chain, replacing `String.UnicodeScalarView.Iterator`
  entirely. Requires `@inline(__always)` on the entire 5-call-deep chain.
  Potential −30–40% on CJK/Thai compare but high risk of regressions from
  inlining failures. Details in `Docs/16` §9.6 and §10.

## How to work

```sh
cd ~/Projects/dra8an/swift-foundation-collation/Collation  # machine 2
swift test                      # full suite, ~7-20s
swift build -c release && .build/out/Products/Release/Bench Tools/bench/bench-ascii.txt 200
```

Regenerating reference data (only when corpus/locales change; needs icu-build):
```sh
cd Tools
ICU_SRC=~/Projects/Unicode/icu-DraganBesevic-2
ICU_BUILD=$ICU_SRC/icu4c/source
clang gen_golden.c -o gen_golden -I $ICU_SRC/icu4c/source/common \
  -I $ICU_SRC/icu4c/source/i18n -L $ICU_BUILD/lib -licuuc -licui18n -licudata
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ICU_BUILD/lib ./gen_golden \
  ../Tests/CollationTests/Golden/corpus.txt ../Tests/CollationTests/Golden
# fuzz keys: same with fuzz-corpus.txt + "--keys-only"; tailorings:
# extract_tailoring.c; norm data: swift run GenNormData <nfc.txt> <nfd.bin>
# test fixtures: extract_locale_suites.py / extract_regcoll.py /
#   extract_cmsccoll.py / extract_g7coll.py
```

## Code map (Sources/Collation/)

- `CollationConstants.swift` — CE32/CE bit layouts, tags, implicit/OFFSET
  primaries (renamed from `Collation` to avoid module/type name collision)
- `UTrie2.swift`, `UCharsTrie.swift` — read-side trie ports
- `CollationData.swift` — "UCol" v5 binary reader (root + tailorings +
  `Reordering`), bundled resources accessors
- `NormalizationData.swift` + `NFDIterator.swift` — nfd.bin reader (v2:
  single-trie, one lookup per scalar) + fused NFD front end (fast path for
  bare starters)
- `CollationElements.swift` — `CEIterator`: lazy CE production, contexts
  (contraction/prefix matching), numeric, base fallback
- `CollationCompare.swift` — level-by-level compare (lazy via `ce(at:)`)
- `CollationFastLatin.swift` — mini-CE fast path for Latin text (compare
  only; scalar and raw-UTF-8 variants; bails out to the regular pipeline)
- `SortKey.swift` — sort key writer + BOCSU identical level
- `CollationOptions.swift` — public options ↔ ICU options word
- `ScratchBuffers.swift` — thread-local buffer reuse (process-wide pthread
  key, monotonic collator IDs), `FastLatinCache`, `FastLatinSetup`
- `DataStorage.swift` — owns the allocated memory behind `UnsafeBufferPointer`
  views in `CollationData` and `NormalizationData`
- `RootCollator.swift` — public API: `compare`, `sortKey`, `sortKey(for:into:)`,
  `init(tailoringNamed:)`, `defaultOptions`; Span-based fast-Latin bail path
  (`#available(macOS 26.0)`)
